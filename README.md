Score ![92 points out of 100](92-out-of-100.png) in [adblock-tester.com test](https://adblock-tester.com/) (Contextual advertising + Analytics Tools + Error Monitoring test -- this program does not block images and GIFs from webpages, because that would block ALL images: to decide which images should be blocked is browser- and website-related. That's why Banner Test was disabled).
